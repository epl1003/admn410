				<h2>History</h2>
					<p> Durham house of pets has been around for 20 years, when it was opened up by a man named Billy Bob.
					in the early days, DHP was just a dog treat manufacturing plant, but over the years has turned into a store that sells
					animals, toys, and anything else you may need for your pet.  From early on, Billy Bob new that he wanted to sell all 
					types of pet goods, but he would have never thought what it would be today.  Now with stores all throughout the east cost
					you can't drive up 95 for more than 10 minutes without seeing a Durham House of Pets.</p>

					<p> The main reason for Durham House of Pets success over the past 20 years is becuase of our impeccable customer service.
					We make this our top priority in order for the customer to have the best experience possible when shopping for their 
					pets.  Also with our "petxpert" employees, we gurantee their ability to help you with anything you may need.  On top of that, after 
					visiting our store, you can bring your pet on a walk all around the UNH campus.  There are great areas for dogs to run around
					including, T-hall lawn, the Fishbowl, or even the lower quad.  Also, don't forget to make a pit stop at the dairy bar for the
